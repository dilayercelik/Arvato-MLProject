# Arvato-MLProject

This GitHub repository hosts the Capstone project I have developed and completed as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

In this project, I have worked on 4 demographics datasets provided Arvato Financial Services, with the intermediary goal of extracting similarities/differences between the general population and the current customer base of a German-based company, in order to predict which individuals are more likely to become new customers (individuals who could then be targeted by the mail-order company campaign). 

This project employ both **unsupervised** (PCA and Dimensionality Reduction, k-Means Clustering and Customer Segmentation) and **supervised** (from scikit-learn...) machine learning algorithms and techniques.


# Table of Contents

- Proposal


# Requirements

The Jupyter Notebook is written in **Python** (3.x. version required). 


The main **packages** used are:

`numpy`: scientific computing tools

`pandas`: data structures and data analysis tools

`matplotlib`: data visualisation tools

`seaborn`: data visualisation tools

`scikit-learn` (sklearn): Machine Learning library in Python



# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank everyone involved in presenting me this Capstone Project, both at Udacity (for their support) and at Arvato Financial Services (for letting us access their private data).
